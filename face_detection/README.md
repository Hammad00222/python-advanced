# Project1: Real-Time Face Detection with OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using Python and OpenCV from your webcam.

## Features
- Reads live video feed from webcam
- Detects faces using Haar Cascade classifier
- Draws bounding boxes around faces and displays face count
- Gracefully handles empty frames or hardware errors

## Setup & Run
```bash
pip install opencv-python
python face_detection.py
